https://stackoverflow.com/questions/673905/how-to-determine-users-locale-within-browser

The stack overflow article suggests that the most reliable method for detecting a user's prefered language is
to read the <Accept-Language> Http header.

However MDN supports that newer browser versions offer the same functionality.

** Server locale-specific content such as dates, currencies and numbers
- Dates
    - Day names
    - Day name format
    - Month names
    - Month name format
    - Time format
- Currencies
    - Value
    - Symbol
- Numbers
    - Decimal points

** Flow
Enter Site -> (detect users locale) -> (store the locale to be offered, in a Cookie or somehing) -> render app

Attach listener to browser settings change
Fire event when user clicks on locale offered

User selects another language -> (store the locale to be offerd, in a Cookie or something) -> render app
User changes his language settings through the browser -> (store the locale to be offered, in a Cookie or something) -> render app

** Local && Session Storage
Setting local storage:
Window.localStorage.setting = "string"
Window.localStorage['setting'] = "string"
Window.localStorage.setItem('setting') = 'string'

Retreiving local storage:
Window.localStorage.setting
Window.localStorage['setting']
Window.localStorage.getItem('setting')

Window.localStorage value is a storage object
Window.sessionStorage value is a storage object
THeir difference is their expiration date. The localStorage storage object persists across even system reboots.
The sessionStorage object does not persist even across browser sessions.

Responding to storage changes with the StorageEvent:
the StorageEvent is fired whenever a change is made to the Storage object.

* Mqtt
An mqtt client is a message delivery agent.

A responsible mqtt client *must* provide such facilities as to be able to bring
forth *accurate*, *definitive* and *up to date* information about the state of a
message.

** Questions
If an mqtt exchange operates in blocking and non-blocking mode (synchronous and
asynchronous) which facilities does npm/mqtt offer for selecting between the 2?

** Glossary
*** Payload
A payload is the client's data admitted for distribution. The term excludes the
data added by the broker.
*** Message
A message is comprised of the payload, the topic and any other information added
by the broker.
*** Topic
A topic is an address of channel.
*** Broker
A broker is relatively equivalent to a server in the mqtt universe.
It is responsible for:

Enabling publishers.
Admitting subscribers.
Making sure to forward messages to their registered channel.
*** Publisher
A client to the broker, who has submitted a payload for distribution to the
network.
*** Subscriber
A client to the broker, who has registered an interest in collecting published
payloads.


** My Client
this.server._subscibe -> asynchronous
this.server._publish -> asynchronous

** tasks
*** Parameters
--verbose
--topics
--subscribe-all
--emulate-load
*** verbose mode
In verbose mode the proxy shall log every important action such as:

a client has stated an intent to subscribe to a channel
a client has stated an intent to publish to a channel
A client successfully subscribed to a channel
A message was successfully forwarded to its destination
A destination could not be located
A destination only accepts one way communication
*** Logging agent
If no logging agent has been provided the client shall default to writting to
the console.
*** adhoc configuration
*** Publish flow
user wants to publish a message and presumably wants to register
a callback to be invoked when a response has arrived.


imitating the http request - response 1.1
user want to publish a message and be notified with the response.

1. register a client.
2. initiate a subscription if none has been initiated.
3. publish the message
4. response arrives.
5. subscription invokeds all registered clients.
6. each registered client is removed from the registry.

User wants to publish a message without wanting to be notified with the
response.
1. publish a messsage.

*** Subscription flow
user wants to subscribe to a channel
1. create a subscription channel.
2. register a listener

* Dialog, Dropdown, Tooltip, Menu
** Interface shared by all these components
*** position
All of these 'modal' components should allow the user to direct the placement
of the modal through a prop called 'position'.

The following positions should be offered.

top-start top top-end
left-start left left-end
bottom-start  bottom bottom-end
right-start right right-end
*** offset

** Dialog
A dialog is a floating element that displays information that requires
immediate attention, appearing over the page content and blocking interactions
with the page until it is dismissed.

It is centered on the viewport, not anchored to any particular reference
element.

It is modal and renders a backdrop behind the dialog that dims the content
behind it, making the rest of the page inaccessible.

A dialog must:

Allow the user to close the dialog by pressing escape.

capture focus within the dialog.
** Dropdown
** Tooltip
*** About
A tooltip is a floating element that displays information related to an anchor
element when it receives keyboard focus or the mouse hovers over.

A tooltip must:

remain attached to its reference element and remain in view for the user
regardless of where it is positioned on the screen

must open when the mouse hovers of focus is within the referenced element.

If the user presses esc while the tooltip is open it should close.

* FLoating Ui (used in making dialogs etc)

** Simplest positioning behavior using defaults
#+begin_src javascript
  function App() {

      // The hook providing the positioning functionality
      const {x, y, strategy, refs } = useFloating();

      return (
              <React.Fragment>

          // useFloating requires 2 things in order to performs its
          // functions. It needs a reference element which provides
          // anchoring. The element to be positioned will be positined
          // relative to the reference element, the anchor element.


          // The reference element
              <button ref={refs.setReference}>Button</button>


          // The floating element
              <tooltip
          ref={refs.setFloating}

** Use floating options
placement
middleware
open
onOpenStart
** Middleware
*** offset
modifies the placement to add distance or margin between the reference and
floating elements
*** inline
positions the floating element relative to individual client rects rather than
the bounding box for better precision
*** shift
prevents the floating element from overflowingc a clipping container by shifting
it to stay in view
*** flip
prevents the floating element from overflowing a clipping ocntainer by flipping
it to the opposite placement to stay in view
*** autoPlacement
automatically chooses a placement for you using a most space strategy
*** size
resiezs the floating element, for example so it will not overflow a clipping
container, or to match the width of the reference element.
*** arrow
provides data to position an inner element of the floating element such that it
is centered to its reference element.
*** hide
provides data to hide the floating element in applicable situations when it no
longer appears attached to its reference element due to different clipping
contexts.

** useFloating
*** What is it?
It is a hook that encapsulates most of the logic that allows the creation of
floating elements relative to a reference element.
*** List its uses
- The ability to declare a reference element
  const { refs } = useFloating();
  <button ref={refs.setReference}/>
- The ability to declare a floating element
  const { refs } = useFloating();
  <button ref={refs.setFloating}/>
- Position coordinates
  const { x, y, strategy } = useFloating();
  <refelement style={{x, y, position: strategy}}/>
- Ability to adjust and completent the behavior of the floating element using middleware
- Get the references to the DOM elements
- const { refs } = useFloating();
  refs.reference.current
  refs.floating.current
- Get the DOM element
  const { elements } = useFloating();
  elements.reference
  elements.floating
- Interactivity

  const actionButton = ({action, children}) => {
      const buttonRef = useRef(null);

      return (
              <button onClick={action} ref={buttonRef}>

*** callback references
A callback reference is an alternate method by which react allows
users to get a reference to a DOM element.

Normally one creates a reference variable using:

const reference = useRef(null);

Then, if the user chooses to link the reference to a DOM element it is done by
assigning the reference to the ref attribute:

<button ref={reference}/>

The linking is done by react. The user has no control over the linking of the
refrence variable to the DOM element.

A callback function transfers control over the linking of the DOM element to the
reference variable  to the user by passing the DOM element to the callback
function at which point the user may use it any way the want.


<button ref={(DOM_ELEMENT) => do_something...}

* UI Lists
A list is any sequence of components that should be treated as such.

What do people expect of lists?

Lists should be navigable using the keyboard arrow keys.
Lists should be navigable using the tab key.
The element currently receiving focus should indicate it.
The element where the pointer resides if any should indicate it, but it should
not switch to a focused state.
If a user tabs away from the widget and returns, focus should return to the
element which last had focus.

* Asynchronous Selects
** Asynchronous Combobox (AsyncCombobox)
An asynchronous combobox is responsible for fetching the data
it requires to fill its option list.

The data set is partitioned into chunks and through infinite scrolling it is
progressively fetched and displayed.

*** load a chunk on open.
combobox toggles to open state.
combobox list is revealed / opened.
combobox infinite scrolling fires dataload event.
combobox changes state to dataloading=true.
combobox fetches data.
combobox data has been fetched.
combobox changes state to dataloading=false.
combobox renders new list.
* Infinite scrolling
Infinite scrolling is implemented using the new *Intersection Observer* API.

the api lets users register a callback function that is executed whenever an
element they wish to monitor enters or exits another element (or the viewport)
or when the amount by which the two intersect changes by a requested amount.

if two components intersect by somewhere around N%, invoke callback.


The registered callback is invoked where in either of these circumstances occur:

1. A target element intersects either the device's viewport or a specified
   element. The specified element is reffered to as the the root element.
2. The first time the observer is initially asked to watch a target element.
   
** threshold
0 -> as soon as one pixel of the target element is visible invoke the handler.
0.25 -> as soon as 25% of the target element is visible invoke the handler.
1 -> the target element's visible surface area must be 100% to invoke the handler.

[0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1] -> invoke the handler 5 times:
  - 0 -> pixel 1
  - 0.25 -> 25% visibility
  - 0.5 -> 50% visibility
  - 0.75 -> 75% visibility
  - 1 -> 100% visibility
                          
** Things to watch out for
*** infinite loop
An infinite loop occurs when:

The user pushing the scrollbar widget towards the edge of the container creates
a situation where:

- the observer target is intersected.
- the observer target fires the handler event, which loads more data.
- more data is loaded and added to the container.
- the container grows
- immediate position change towards the end of the container due to the fixed
  pointer.
- loop

How does one prevent this behavior from ever occuring?

Google offers the following solution:

Instead of having just one observer target positioned at the end of the
container there are two observer targets.

They are named:

1) sentinel
2) button


The sentinel fetches data.
The button appends any available data.


The sentinel is not positioned at the bottom of the container.
Instead it is always placed mid way from the current scroll position to the
bottom of the container.

If the user fixates his pointer towards the end of the scrollbar, the sentinel
is never observed. No more data is fetched. When the button is observed and
fires the event to append more data, there is none. That puts a stop to the
infinite loop.

This approach has the disadvantage of:

- Calculating the position of the sentinel element to appropriately place it.
- The user must scroll relatively smoothly, otherwise the sentinel is never
  observed.

About:
This article seeks to define the structure of a module in terms of file[s],
filenames and exported objects.

A module represents an encapsulated, discreet, homogenous (uniform) piece of
functionality.

That does not mean that a module exports strictly one object. A discreet piece
of functionality may be separated into multiple sections as per the separation
of concerns (wikipedia: separation of concerns) design principle. Separating a
service into multiple sections should not be interpreted to mean necessarily
multiple files which is an implementation detail. A module offering a service
split into sections may be named a 'composite' service. Whilst a service not
split into sections may be named a 'simple' service.

In general the objects found within a module may be placed under one of two
categories.
Exported or not-Exported.
Interface or Implementation.
External or Internal.

The placement of the objects of any type is an implementation detail. Meaning
that the programmer may either choose to split the code into multiple files or
not. Keep in mind that splitting a service into multiple files does not mean
that module exports a 'composite' service. It may very well be that each of
these files defines a not-exported object for internal consumption.

Be that as it may the principle goes:

Directory structure:
If a module exporting a service (composite or simple) is spread out into
multiple files then:

- Directory houses the service.
- index.js file serves as the entry point.
  check the index.js pattern

If a module exporting a service (composite or simple) is contained within one
file then:

- there is no need for a directory.
- there is no need for the index.js pattern.

Ecmascript exports:

Regardless of the directory structure a service using ES modules has a
choice of either using a 'default export' or a 'named export'.

Default exports should not be used.
Only named exports. As such:

export { componentA, componentB };

The export statement itself should always be placed at the end of the file.
Placing the export statement at the end of the file and not at the start allows
exporting objects which do not support *hoisting*.

Consider the statements:

export { fn };
const fn = () => {};

Evaluating these statements shall throw an Error. The identifier fn has not been
declared yet.

The previous example would work if:

const fn = () => {};
export { fn };
